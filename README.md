Learn Python Programming with me.

These Python files are meant to be explored. Some examples show possible text errors that beginners should know and understand,
to be able to identify such errors from occurring.

Please note: any Python programming examples, which are not 'mine', I will sternly give credit those of whom I've used examples from,
such as Corey Schafer and Programming with Mosh.

99% of anything else is all my very own, dedicated Python programming skills and works, which so far had taken me three years to fully start to understand
Object Oriented Programming Languages, such as Python.

However, my "Python Programmer's Glossary Bible" By Joseph C. Richardson does not and will not contain any Python programming examples from others, unless others want to build onto it, knowingly first.

I sincerely hope you will want to learn as much Python programming skills, as I, myself am still learning all about Python, Object Oriented Programming.

Explore the Wonderful World of Robotics Programming.

If anyone has a Robomaster S1 from DJI, why not have some fun learning all about how to program it with me, as I am still very new to the Robomaster S1’s Python programming abilities. So far, all my Robomaster S1 Python program codes are just simple for now. You can learn how to program the LED’s, the blaster, the gimbal and the chassis.

So why not have some fun and learn to program the Robomaster S1 with me. I will keep adding more and more Robomaster S1 Python programming examples.

Because, the more I can learn is the more fun we both can have.
